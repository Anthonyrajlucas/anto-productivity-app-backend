## Testing

The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing of user stories


### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Task | Create, update & delete | A Task can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
My Invention task | Create, edit & delete | my invention task can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
 | profiles |  A profiles relationship between a Task and a User can be delete profile, update profile and upload image | Works as expected
My duty task | update status | A dusty task can be update status, save and cancel | Works as expected


In addition, tasks, my invention task, my duty task and profiles can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.
