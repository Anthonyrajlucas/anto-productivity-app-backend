## User Stories

- The back-end section of the project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit, and delete users, tasks, task statuses, categories, priorities, and statuses. so that I can have control over the content of the application and also remove any potentially inappropriate content.


## Database
